------
Python versions **2.7**, **3.3** and **3.4** are supported. Python **2.6** is no longer supported.

If you are using a different Python variant such as PyPy or IronPython then please help to improve
support by providing feedback.

come bundled with `HTTPStream <http://nigelsmall.com/httpstream>`_,
`JSONStream <http://nigelsmall.com/jsonstream>`_ and `URIMagic <http://nigelsmall.com/urimagic>`_
which are used internally for HTTP communication.


Installation
============
Py2neo can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::

    pip install py2neo


Source Code
===========

The source code is also available from GitHub but be sure to checkout the correct release branch.
